        <p>It seems like everyone is online these days. The Internet not only facilitates interpersonal communication
            between users (e.g., email, social media); it's also a much relied-upon source for all kinds of information.
            And a convenient means of paying bills and making purchases. Every single online application has that part
            with which users interact. When you log onto a website, you are greeted by the welcome page, the menu, site
            map, and other items that facilitate navigation and utility. All of those items fall under the collective
            term of “front end.” The front end includes the user interface, which is the part of the website or app
            designed for the consumer's use. Without further ado, before getting started with how to become a front-end
            developer let us first undersatnd what is a front end developer. </p>
